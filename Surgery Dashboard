#Surgery Dashboard

This dashboard will enhance operating theatre utilization and empower surgeons with actionable insights. This solution will provide real-time data on revenue generation, procedural trends, and individual performance metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize operations and improve overall efficiency.
#Summary 
Total of 710 surgeries were performed generating a total revenue of over GHC300,000 over the 12months period

#Steps followed
- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.

- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : The data type for Age column was changed to whole number from text .
- Step 4 : We created new measures
 using the following DAX 

Total surgeries performed = COUNTROWS(Surgery2024)
%Percent of surgeries = Surgery2024[Total surgeries performed]/710*100

Number of surgery by OT = CALCULATE(SUM(Surgery2024[Cost of Surgery]), ALLEXCEPT(Surgery2024,Surgery2024[OT Name]))

Procedure cost = CALCULATE(SUM(Surgery2024[Cost of Surgery]), ALLEXCEPT(Surgery2024,Surgery2024[Procedure Performed]))

Revenue by OT = CALCULATE(SUM(Surgery2024[Cost of Surgery]), ALLEXCEPT(Surgery2024,Surgery2024[OT Name]))

Procedure revenue by Surgeon in each month= CALCULATE(SUM(Surgery2024[Cost of Surgery]), ALLEXCEPT(Surgery2024,Surgery2024[Month Name],Surgery2024[Surgeon],Surgery2024[Procedure Performed]))

TOTAL REVENUNE BY SURGEON = CALCULATE(SUM(Surgery2024[Cost of Surgery]), ALLEXCEPT(Surgery2024, Surgery2024[Surgeon]))

#Insights 
Theater Utilization:

The General Operation Theatre is more consistently utilized compared to Theatre 2, which shows a spike in June but lower usage overall.
This suggests potential underutilization of Theatre 2 or differences in case distribution.
Surgery Revenue:

Caesarean Sections are the most significant contributor to revenue ($162K), making them a critical focus for resource allocation.
Other procedures like External Hernia Repair, Myomectomy, and Laparotomy generate significantly less revenue.
Surgeon Performance:

Dr. Frank Adu-Poku leads in surgeries performed (223) and revenue generated, accounting for 31.41% of all surgeries.
Surgeries peak in May and June, with notable dips in February and August. This could indicate scheduling patterns, seasonal demands, or resource availability.

Revenue Distribution by Theater:
The General Operation Theatre generates 68.32% of total revenue, significantly outperforming Theatre 2.
This dashboard provides a clear view of operational performance, helping stakeholders make informed decisions to optimize resources, enhance surgeon performance, and improve financial outcomes.
